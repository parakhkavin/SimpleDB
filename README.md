## 📖 Overview

This visualizer shows how different sorting algorithms rearrange a list of random integers in ascending or descending order. The sorting process is animated in real-time with colored highlights to indicate active comparisons and swaps.

---

## ✨ Features

- Real-time visualization using `pygame`
- Toggle between ascending and descending order
- Color-coded steps for comparisons and swaps
- Easily switch between sorting algorithms during runtime
- Responsive and user-friendly interface
